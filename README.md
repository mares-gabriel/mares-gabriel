About me? Well... I love bringing ideas to life, don't ask me why, I just purely love seeing how things work together to create something beautiful. Whether it’s building seamless UIs with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, optimizing for SEO, or integrating powerful backends with Firebase or Supabase, I love how everything connects and works as a whole. Actually, someone once asked me if I prefer frontend or backend, and, honestly? I can't decide, because I love them both!

In everything I do, I stick to quality over quantity and constantly push myself to keep learning, even when it feels like I'm always running to keep up 🏃 — from mastering TypeScript and JavaScript to exploring better design patterns, version control with Git, and performance optimization.

Also, if I ever get another pet, it might be a mink. Or a duck. Or maybe... a penguin? I haven’t decided yet, but I do know one thing: I’d love to take care of all of them! 🦦🦆🐧
